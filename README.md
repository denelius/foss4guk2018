Introduction to D3.js and Leaflet workshop
A fun introduction to D3.js and Leaflet - In this workshop we will build a mapping application that uses the D3.js library to enhance your data with visualizations. We will attempt to shed some light on the dark art of D3.js and look at how it interacts with Leaflet. D3.js is a lot of fun and has a vast amount of visualization potential, it uses web standards, so is very accessible and is a logical pairing for Leaflet. We will use NodeJS and at the end of the workshop you will have working code and a mapping application.
